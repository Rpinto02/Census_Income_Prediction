# Census Income Prediction

Classification challenge on the census income US data


The goal of this challenge is to identify characteristics that are associated with a person earning more or less than $50,000 per year and build a classification model for that threshold.

This challenge is divided into 5 notebooks that should be read in the following order:

* EDA - Exploratory data analysis.
* Data_preparation - Data preparation according to the EDA
* Modelling - Data modelling and model assessment
* Feature_Exploration - Feature importance analysis and recursive feature elimination
